#Recursive geometric fractals

Interactive visualization of **recursive geometric fractals** using **p5.js** and **Chart.js**. 
This project allows to explore, manipulate, and export classic fractals with customizable parameters.

## Fractals Included

- **Koch's Curve (Snowflake)** – recursive line segments forming a snowflake-like curve.
- **Sierpinski Triangle** – triangular fractal formed by recursive subdivision.
- **Pythagoras Tree** – binary tree built recursively with squares.
- **Harter-Heighway's Dragon Curve** – self-similar recursive curve.

## Features

- **Interactive controls**:
  - Adjust recursion depth for each fractal.
  - Zoom in/out dynamically.
- **Real-time charts** showing the number of elements per recursion depth using logarithmic scale.
- **Export options**:
  - PNG images for individual fractals.
  - PDF reports combining images and numerical data.
- **Responsive design** – works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iryna-romashko/Recursive-Geometric-Fractals.git
